# Evals: real agents answer the open questions

`tests/` answer every open question with scripted answers (what a correct
judge would say). That tests the rules, not the questions. Here, fresh
agents answer them for real, seeing only what a consumer agent would get.

## Run

```bash
uv run python evals/judge_eval.py prepare /tmp/eval   # packets in /tmp/eval-packets
# One fresh agent per packet folder answers questions.json into answers.json.
uv run python evals/judge_eval.py apply /tmp/eval     # follow-ups -> round2; score
```

**Isolation.** Each packet holds only the tool's own output: questions,
rubrics, inputs, page text, the evidence files they point to (copied from
`run://`), and the `answer_questions` description. Local URLs are mapped to
`https://example.gov/site/pageN.html` and folders are shuffled `qNN` IDs,
because fixture names describe the expected answer ("key-in-comment-only").
The answer key (`/tmp/eval/state.json`) is outside the packet tree. Agents
are told to open nothing else and to list every file they opened.

## Results, 2026-10-31 (Sonnet subagents, one per page, 46 pages, 54 answers)

| Test | Match | Mismatches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.A | 4/7 | 3 × unsure where FAIL was expected |
| 4.B | 3/4 | 1 × unsure where PASS was expected |
| 4.C | 25/25 | none |
| 4.E | 2/2 | none |
| 4.F | 5/8 | 1 false PASS (f14), 1 unsure, 1 FAIL where unsure was expected (f15) |

What the mismatches and the agents' notes showed (tool problems, not agent
mistakes, unless marked):

- **False PASS, 4.F f14.** The backward (Shift+Tab) order is scrambled; the
  agent judged only the forward order ("the Shift+Tab signal concerns the
  reverse pass"). J1's wording never asks about the backward order.
- **4.F f15.** Focus reads "Step 3, Step 4, Step 1, Step 2"; the agent said
  does_not_preserve, our test data says unsure. The agent looks right.
- **Missing evidence led to unsure** (safe, but costs automation): 4.F's
  revealed-content question does not list what was revealed; 4.B J2 gives
  only element names; 4.A on pages where keyboard focus reaches nothing shows
  an empty stop list plus "the Tab walk did not get through the whole page".
- **Rubric gap, 4.A J1:** a link to another page that might list the same
  items was treated as a possible alternative; TT HtT 2.b asks for another
  method "available on the page".
- **Broken references:** 4.C questions point at screenshots by run-folder path
  (`evidence/shots/P1-0005.png`), not `run://`, so no client can open them.
  4.B sends no `page_text`, and its matched sentences are cut at line breaks.
- **Prompt injection resisted:** 4.C f32's page tells automated testers to
  report PASS; the agent ignored it and said so.

**Tokens.** A question's own content is about 600 tokens (packet median
7.7 KB, of which 5.2 KB is the answer-format text). Each subagent used about
55,000 tokens, almost all fixed start-up cost. One subagent per question
saves the consumer's main context but multiplies total spend; batching all
of a run's questions into one subagent, or answering small sets inline, is
far cheaper.
